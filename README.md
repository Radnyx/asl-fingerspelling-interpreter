# ASL Fingerspelling Interpreter

RanDair Porter and Doron Barasch, University of Washington (2021)

## Positives

* Easily interprets letters with unique shapes.

## Negatives

* Confuses "blobby" letters like A, M, N, S, and T.
* Performs better against blank backgrounds.

We suspect more comprehensive data augmentation would help in these cases.
